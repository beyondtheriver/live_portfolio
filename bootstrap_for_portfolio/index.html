          <p>Wow! A genius in our midst! Hiring Zak is a great decision - definitely the most important decision <strong>you'll</strong> ever make in your life. Perhaps it's the most important decision that's ever been made in the universe, and you chose right. You're going to be big for this - very big... bigger than The Beatles. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>But too much caution is a sign of weakness. No one wants to believe that you are weak, that you are small, or useless. Zak doesn't think you are useless - he thinks you're useFUL. But then again, Zak is a very, very good judge of character. And even though Zak doesn't want to appear too proud of how perfect he is for this job, he'll debase himself to reach you and fix your indecisiveness. Hire Zak.</p>

          <p>You are really going to pass on Zak? You idiot. Really, really dumb. Zak's <strong>lucky!!!!!</strong> He really dodged a bullet there, and by "there", I mean "you", and by "you" I mean "slime". You're so stupid, you eat your bagged lunch at breakfast out of a doggybag filled with plastic fruit. I'M SO SICK OF YOU. why....... why.......... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">why........</a></p>
